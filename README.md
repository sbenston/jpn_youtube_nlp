# Frequency and Morphological Analysis of YouTube Comments

## TO-DO:
1) Analyze usage of ます-です usage versus plain forms
2) Frequency for most common POS
3) Compare with daily conversation corpus
4) Make summary visualizations

## Analysis Overview

Opportunities to use a language outside one's mother tongue in the present day are ever present with the ability to find an online discussion about any topic of interest. As a supplement these conversations can provide a low-stakes environment to practice writing, with many caveats as with any language online speech is liable to not be exactly representative of correct usage. However for a language like Japanese where speakers are geographically limited to the country, SNS sites like Twitter, chat applications, and discussion boards are some of the only places to use the language to communicate outside of groups made expressly for that purpose for learners living outside the country.

This analysis uses YouTube comments as an example of one place where one could find topics of interest and participate in online discussion, and is performed under the lens of questions that foreign-language learners of Japanese would have about word usage in these spaces. Understanding these are a step towards participating in discussions in a natural way where things are not lost in translation.

Questions of interest:
* What are the most frequent words overall for some of the top videos?
  * What are the top words for each part of speech?
* How many comments lead to further discussion?
  * Does usage change for replies vs. top-level comments?
* Are comments more typically in informal speech?
  * Does usage change for replies vs. top-level comments?
* How does online frequency compare to in-person conversation?
